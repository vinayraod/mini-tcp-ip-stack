# Mini TCP/IP Stack

A TCP/IP protocol simulation for file transfer from one system to another system over a network was developed as a part of the coursework for the Computer Communication and Networking course.
- Simulated the 3-way Handshake in Transport Layer
- Simulated the MAC Layer. CRC-32 error checking algorithm implemented.
- Simulated the working of the IP and Application layers.
